Cool.\n            \n\n              When ready to serve, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons chocolate chips in a small bowl in the microwave. Generously sift confectioners' sugar over the ghosts. To make the ghost eyes, lightly touch 2 spots on the head of each ghost with a moist finger to remove some of the sugar. Then dab or pipe the melted chocolate in the 2 spots to make eyes. Cool, remove the foil molds and serve standing on a platter.\n            \n\n              Copyright 2005 Television Food Network, G.P.
