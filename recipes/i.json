In a small bowl toss the bread crumbs with milk to re-hydrate.\n            \n\n              In a large bowl, combine the bread crumbs, pork, veal, beef, Parmesan, parsley, salt, onion, garlic, and egg and mix until combined. Season the meat mixture with pepper.\n            \n\n              Using your hands, gently form the meat mixture into 18 slightly larger than golf ball-sized balls. (Packing the meat mixture too tightly together will result in tough meatballs). Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.\n            \n\n              Heat half the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add half of the meatballs and cook, turning occasionally, until well browned on all sides, about 6 minutes. Transfer the meatballs to a plate. Drain the oil and wipe out the skillet, return to the heat, and repeat with the remaining oil and meatballs.\n            \n\n              Drain and wipe out the skillet again. Return all the meatballs to the skillet and pour in the marinara sauce. Bring to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer, covered, swirling the pan occasionally, until the meatballs are cooked through about 15 minutes. The cheese in the meatballs will start to melt when the meatballs are ready. Serve immediately with the Quick Marinara Sauce and spaghetti or on sandwiches. If serving with spaghetti, toss with 1/3 of the sauce.These meatballs can be stored, covered in the refrigerator for 3 days, or frozen for up to 6 weeks.\n            \n\n              Copyright (c) 2004 Television Food Network, G.P., All Rights Reserved.\n            \n\n              Serving suggestions: 1 pound cooked spaghetti or linguini.\n            \n\n              Quick Marinara Sauce\n            \n\n              1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil\n            \n\n              1/4 medium onion, diced (about 3 tablespoons)\n            \n\n              4 cloves garlic, sliced\n            \n\n              3 (28-ounce) cans whole, peeled, tomatoes, roughly chopped\n            \n\n              3 sprigs fresh thyme\n            \n\n              1 small bunch fresh basil, leaves chopped\n            \n\n              2 teaspoons kosher salt\n            \n\n              Freshly ground black pepper\n            \n\n              Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.
