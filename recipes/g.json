Add the brown sugar, butter, corn syrup, vanilla and salt, and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture has thickened and coats the back of a spoon, 5 to 6 minutes.

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons cream to the chocolate mixture, and beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until lightened in color and fluffy, about 1 minute (do not overbeat, or it will become hard and grainy).

Remove from the heat and sprinkle the yeast and a pinch of granulated sugar over top. Set aside undisturbed until foamy, about 5 minutes.\n            \n\n              Whisk together the salt, 2 3/4 cups flour and remaining granulated sugar in a large bowl. Generously butter a 10-inch springform pan.\n            \n\n              Combine the melted butter, vanilla and egg yolk in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix on low until combined. Add the yeast mixture and continue to mix on low until combined. Add the flour mixture and mix on low until a thick and slightly sticky dough forms. Once the dough comes together, switch to the dough hook and knead on medium speed, adding up to 1/4 cup more flour if needed, to make a soft, smooth ball that sticks to the hook, 3 to 4 minutes.\n            \n\n              Coat a large bowl generously with cooking spray. Add the dough, turning to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature until the dough is doubled in size, about 1 hour.\n            \n\n              For the filling: Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter and cook, swirling, until melted. Add the diced apples and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 8 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the apple butter. Transfer to a medium bowl to cool completely.\n            \n\n              When the dough is ready, punch it down and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead a few times, then roll into a rectangle 12 inches by 18 inches, keeping the longer side closest to you. Spread the cooled apple filling evenly all over the dough. Sprinkle with the granulated sugar. Use a pizza cutter to cut the dough crosswise into 1-inch strips. Starting on the left side, roll 1 strip up jelly roll style. When you get to the end, press another strip to the first one and continue rolling. Repeat this with 2 more strips. Carefully transfer the rolled dough to the center of the prepared pan. The spiral should be facing up. Continue coiling the remaining strips of dough filling-side in around the middle roll until the pan is filled. This might get messy, but that's part of the fun. Loosely cover the pan with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.\n            \n\n              Position an oven rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F.

Reduce the oven temperature to 325 and roast 2 more hours.\u00a0\n            \n\n              Make the glaze: Whisk the peach preserves, brown sugar, mustard, vinegar, ginger, and salt and pepper to taste in a bowl. Brush the ham with half of the glaze; continue roasting until deep golden, about 1 more hour. Brush the ham with the remaining glaze, turn it on its side and roast until a thermometer inserted into the center registers 155 and the skin is crisp, 30 to 45 more minutes. Transfer to a cutting board, tent with foil and let rest 20 minutes before carving.\n            \n\n              Skim the fat from the roasting pan juices and discard the bay leaves.

Mix slowly with an electric mixer until stiff enough to form peaks; the icing should be pure white and thick, but not fluffy and bubbly. If the frosting is over beaten, it will get aerated which makes it harder to work with. If this happens, let the frosting sit to settle, and then use a rubber spatula to vigorously beat and smooth out the frosting.\n            \n\n              Add up to 1 tablespoon food coloring and mix with a rubber spatula until the color is uniform. Gels are best with royal icing. You don't want to thin them with liquid colors. Be careful of adding too much color, which reduces the sheen of the frosting and can break down the consistency of the frosting over a couple of days.

Combine the gingersnap crumbs, butter, brown sugar, molasses and pumpkin pie spice in a food processor and pulse to combine. (You may add a little of the cream to get the mixture more malleable.)

Using the plastic overhang as handles, remove the truffle mixture in one piece. Flip onto your work surface and remove the plastic so the smoothest side faces up. Use a 1 1/2-inch gingerbread person cutter to cut out 12 gingerbread men. (After cutting the gingerbread men, you may roll the extra truffle mixture into balls for round truffles, if desired.)

Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Keeping the other disk refrigerated, roll one disk to an 1/8-inch thickness on a well-floured surface, sprinkling flour on and under the dough as needed and sliding a spatula underneath every so often to prevent sticking. If the dough looks crackly or breaks apart, press it back together from the outside edge in. With a 4-inch gingerbread man cookie cutter, cut out gingerbread people as close together on the dough as possible. Pull away the extra dough around each shape and use a small spatula to transfer the people to the prepared cookie sheets about 1 inch apart. Gather together the scraps, leaving behind the excess flour, and knead them a few times to form a smooth dough again. Reroll them in the same way. (If there are any pieces of dough stuck on your surface, scrape them away with a spatula, flour the surface again and then continue to roll the dough.) Check to see if the cutter fits inside the mugs. If the legs are too wide, gently push the legs of the dough cut-outs closer together to make them fit. Freeze the cookies to firm them, about 15 minutes.\n            \n\n              Bake the cookies in the center of the oven racks, rotating the sheets from top to bottom and also turning them 180 degrees around halfway through baking, until they are slightly firm to the touch but not brown, about 12 minutes. Repeat the process with the remaining dough.\n            \n\n              Cool the cookies 5 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer to a rack to cool completely before icing.

(If the dough gets too soft while rolling, return it to the refrigerator for 15 minutes before proceeding.) Discard the dough scraps or reroll to make cookies. Chill the dough pieces on the baking sheets for 15 minutes.\u00a0\n            \n\n              Bake the gingerbread: Bake the dough pieces until crisp almost all the way through (the very center will still be a little soft), 30 to 35 minutes. Cool the pans 10 minutes on a rack, then remove the house pieces to the rack to cool completely. Assemble and decorate the gingerbread panels as desired.\n            \n", "ingredients": [{"food": "potato flour", "quantity": 3.0}, {"food": "ginger", "quantity": 1.0}, {"food": "cinnamon", "quantity": 1.5}, {"food": "baking chocolate", "quantity": 0.5}, {"food": "nutmeg", "quantity": 0.5}, {"food": "cloves", "quantity": 0.25}, {"food": "salt", "quantity": 0.5}, {"food": "butter oil", "quantity": 4.5}, {"food": "shortening confectionery", "quantity": 4.0}, {"food": "sugar", "quantity": 0.5}, {"food": "sugar", "quantity": 0.3333333333333333}, {"food": "egg substitute", "quantity": 1.0}, {"food": "molasses", "quantity": 0.5}, {"food": "vanilla extract", "quantity": 1.0}], "title": "\nGingerbread for a Gingerbread House\n"}]
