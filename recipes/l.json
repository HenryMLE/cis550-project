Let the chickpeas sit in the strainer to drain and dry out for 5 minutes. Put the chickpeas in the bowl of a food processor along with the tahini, lemon juice, garlic, all but a pinch of the dill and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and process until the mixture is a paste, scraping down the bowl as necessary. With the motor running, slowly pour in 1/4 cup of the ice water and continue to process until the mixture is smooth and light, about 5 minutes, adding more water a tablespoon at a time until the desired consistency is reached.\n            \n\n              Transfer the hummus to a shallow bowl and cover by lightly pressing plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the hummus; let sit at room temperature until ready to serve, up to 1 hour. (The hummus can also be made a day ahead and refrigerated. Take the hummus out of the refrigerator to warm up 30 minutes before serving.)\n            \n\n              Before serving, remove the plastic wrap from the hummus. Smooth the outer rim of the hummus with the back of a large kitchen spoon, creating a slight well in the center. Dollop the yogurt in the center. Scatter the radish slices and capers on top, sprinkle with the reserved dill and serve with slices of pumpernickel bread and cucumbers.\n            \n", "ingredients": [{"food": "chickpeas", "quantity": 8.0}, {"food": "baking chocolate", "quantity": 2.0}, {"food": "", "quantity": 0.75}, {"food": "", "quantity": 3.5}, {"food": "garlic powder", "quantity": 3.0}, {"food": "dill seed", "quantity": 0.5}, {"food": "salt", "quantity": 1}, {"food": "ice cream swich", "quantity": 0.5}, {"food": "silk banana-strawberry soy yogurt", "quantity": 0.25}, {"food": "pasta with sliced franks in tomato sauce", "quantity": 1.0}, {"food": "pasta with sliced franks in tomato sauce", "quantity": 2.0}, {"food": "garlic bread", "quantity": 1}], "title": "\nLemony Dill Hummus Dip\n"}, {"directions": "\n\n              Trim 1 bunch broccoli; peel the stems and quarter the bunch lengthwise.
