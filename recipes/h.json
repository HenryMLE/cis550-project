Remove the saucepan from the heat, and sprinkle the yeast over the liquid. Sprinkle a pinch of the granulated sugar over the top, and set aside without stirring until foamy, about 5 minutes.

Cover the entire bowl tightly with the rest of the plastic, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight to let the dough proof.\n            \n\n              To make the filling: Melt the butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the leeks, and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and just beginning to caramelize, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the leeks with the flour, and cook, stirring constantly, until lightly browned and toasted, about 1 minute. Whisk in the wine and 1/4 cup water, and let the mixture thicken, whisking constantly, about 1 minute. Remove the skillet from the heat, and stir in the Gruyere, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Transfer the filling to a medium bowl, and let cool completely. (The filling will firm up a bit, but if it's too warm, it will be difficult to form the rolls.)\n            \n\n              To fill and form the rolls: Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with the 2 tablespoons softened butter. Turn the dough onto a floured work surface, and press it flat. Roll it into a 10-by-18-inch rectangle, with 1 long edge facing you. Spread the cooled filling evenly over the dough, leaving about a 1-inch border on the side opposite you. Sprinkle the ham over the filling. Starting from the side facing you, roll the dough up into a tight roll. Lightly brush the 1-inch border with water, and continue rolling to seal the roll.

If you do not have a pizza stone, preheat a baking sheet that has been flipped over bottom-side up. Cut two 12-inch squares of parchment and dust with flour.\n            \n\n              On a floured surface, stretch one ball of dough to a 12-inch round, leaving a thick 3/4-inch border on the edge. Slide the dough onto one of the parchment squares, then slide the square onto the back of a baking sheet. Brush the entire round with 1/2 tablespoon oil. Spread the dough up to the border with half the tomato sauce. Dollop the pizza with half the pesto using a teaspoon. Sprinkle with 1/3 cup of the mozzarella and a pinch crushed red pepper. (Don't worry if it looks like too little cheese. It will melt and spread.) Slide the pizza and parchment from the baking sheet onto the hot pizza stone.\n            \n\n              Bake the pizza until the edges turn golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes, rotating halfway through cooking. Let cool for 2 minutes before slicing.
