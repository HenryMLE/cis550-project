Cover the bowl and set dough aside at room temperature for 1 hour.\n            \n\n              Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment or coat with nonstick spray.\n            \n\n              With a tablespoon, scoop out 1-inch pieces of dough and roll into balls between the palms of your hands.
