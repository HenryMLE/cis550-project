Spread the filling evenly over the dough, leaving about a 1-inch border on the side opposite you. Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan evenly over the filling. Starting from the side facing you, roll the dough up into a tight roll. Lightly brush the 1-inch border with water, and continue rolling to seal the roll. Fold the ends in just a bit, and if any spots look thicker than others, even out the roll with your hands.\n            \n\n              Cut the roll every 1 1/2 inches with a serrated knife, to make 12 buns.

Swirl the pan to distribute the butter as it melts. When the butter stops sizzling and the foam subsides add the eggs.
