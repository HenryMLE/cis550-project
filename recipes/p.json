Bake for 30 minutes.\n            \n\n              For the streusel: While the pie bakes, make the strussel topping by combining the flour, almonds, brown sugar, melted butter and salt in a small bowl until evenly moistened.\n            \n\n              Remove the pie from the oven and sprinkle the streusel evenly over the filling.
