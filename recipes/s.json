Bring the milk to a simmer in a wide nonreactive pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. Remove from the heat and stir in the yogurt, lemon juice and 2 teaspoons salt. Continue to stir gently until large curds form and separate from the whey, 1 to 2 minutes. Strain through the cheesecloth-lined colander, discarding the whey. Gather the ends of the cheesecloth and twist to squeeze out any excess whey (run the sides of the bundle under cool water if it's too hot to handle). Tie the ends of the cheesecloth around a wooden spoon handle and lay the spoon over the colander, letting the bundle dangle; let drain, 10 minutes.\u00a0\n            \n\n              Untie the bundle and twist the cheesecloth again, squeezing out any more whey. Lay the bundle on its side on a plate. Top with another plate and weigh it down with a large can. Refrigerate until a firm cake forms, about 1 hour; unwrap and refrigerate in an airtight container until ready to use, or up to 2 days.\u00a0\n            \n\n              Fry the cheese: Cut the cheese into 3/4-inch cubes. Toss in the flour until well coated, shaking off any excess. Heat about 1/2 inch vegetable oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Carefully add the cheese and fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Season lightly with salt and set aside.\u00a0\n            \n\n              Make the spinach: Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Working in batches, cook the spinach until just tender, about 30 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl of salted ice water. Drain and squeeze dry, then chop and set aside.\u00a0\n            \n\n              Pulse the ginger, garlic, jalapeno, coriander, cumin, turmeric and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a food processor until finely chopped.

Add the ginger mixture and cook, stirring, until toasted, about 5 minutes (add a splash of water if the mixture is sticking). Reduce the heat to medium low; add 1/2 cup water and scrape up any browned bits, then add the cooked spinach and stir until heated through, about 4 minutes.

Pipe icing onto the backs of 4 of the fig bar pieces and attach them to the panels as evenly spaced windows shutters. Pipe icing to draw 2 windows between the shutters. Line the frames with pretzel sticks, breaking them to fit. Pipe a pea-size dot of icing onto the backs of 9 of the butterscotch candies and press them along the bottom of the panel. Repeat this process on the remaining side panel. Let the panels rest until set, 30 minutes to 1 hour.\n            \n\n              Decorate the front panel: Using the piping bag fitted with a small tip, pipe a double line of icing across the front panel where the roof starts to incline; press on about 11 French toast cereal pieces. Pipe a small dot of icing onto the back of 1 of the red sprinkle-coated gummy candies and attach it to the front panel just above the line of cereal. To make a flower, pipe a small dot of icing on the cut sides of 8 of the toasted-marshmallow jelly bean pieces and attach them in a ring around the red gummy. Pipe icing to draw a door; attach the caramel jelly bean with a dot of icing to make a doorknob. Pipe icing onto the backs of the gummy gingerbread people and place 1 on either side of the door. Pipe icing to draw 2 windows; line the frames with pretzel sticks, breaking them to fit.

Pipe a small dot of icing onto the back of the remaining red sprinkle-coated gummy candy and attach it just above the line of cereal. To make a flower, pipe a small dot of icing on the cut sides of the remaining 8 toasted-marshmallow jelly bean pieces and attach them in a ring around the red gummy. Create a decorative trim by piping a pea-size dot of icing onto the backs of the caramel-coated pretzels and pressing them along the bottom of the panel.

Repeat until both roof panels are completely covered. Let the panels rest until set, 30 minutes to 1 hour.\n            \n\n              For the caramel: Spread the sugar in a medium skillet (see Cook's Note). Sprinkle with the lemon juice and 1/4 cup water. Set the skillet over medium-low heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sugar melts, about 2 to 3 minutes. Once the sugar has melted, stop stirring and cook, swirling the contents occasionally, until the sugar syrup is a deep amber color, about 12 to 15 minutes.\n            \n\n              Assemble the walls: Carefully place the skillet of hot caramel by your work surface (you will use it like glue to attach the panels to the base and to one another). Dip the bottom of the front panel in the caramel and place it on the foil-wrapped base. Use a silicone brush to brush a line of caramel along the inside of the panel at the base to reinforce it. Prop up the panel with a can. Brush more caramel up 1 edge of the front panel so you can attach the side of the house. Dip 1 side of a side panel in the caramel and place it perpendicular to the front panel, forming a corner. Brush the inside of the panel along the base with more caramel to reinforce it. Prop up the side piece with a can. Repeat with the second side panel and the back panel. Sprinkle the seams of the house with sea salt.\u00a0\n            \n\n              Attach the roof: Once the walls are set enough to hold the roof panels and while the caramel in the skillet is still warm, remove the cans. Then brush the warm caramel onto the back of a roof panel along the edges (where the roof will attach to the walls); press the panel onto the house and hold it in place until the caramel sets, about 30 seconds. Repeat with the other roof panel. Use the piping bag fitted with a large tip to pipe icing along the seams of the roof to reinforce it.\n            \n\n              Landscape the yard: Using the piping bag fitted with a large tip, pipe a rectangular walkway in front of the house; line the edges with pecan halves and pave the middle with crushed sesame candy. Pipe icing snowdrifts around the walkway and the base of the house; sprinkle with popcorn, pressing it gently into the icing so it sticks.\n            \n\n              Using the piping bag fitted with a large tip, pipe more icing along the top seam of the roof; line with a row of the fluted gummy caramels.

Add the rice, reduce the heat and simmer, stirring once or twice, until the rice is tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Drain, shaking the colander to remove any excess water. Spread the rice on a rimmed baking sheet and let cool.\n            \n\n              Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F and place a baking sheet on the middle rack. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until soft, about 8 minutes. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 6 minutes. Tear the basil and add to the skillet along with the garlic and tomato paste. Increase the heat to high and cook, stirring, until the tomato paste browns, about 4 minutes. Stir in the chicken broth, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes.\n            \n\n              Meanwhile, grease the bottom and sides of an 8-inch springform pan with the remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Coat the pan with the breadcrumbs, tapping to remove any excess. Put the eggs and all but 3 tablespoons of the pecorino cheese in a small bowl and beat with a fork. Put the cooled rice in a bowl; add the egg mixture and stir to combine.\n            \n\n              Transfer about two-thirds of the rice mixture to the prepared springform pan. Using moist fingers, pat the rice onto the bottom and up the sides of the pan, forming a 1/2-inch-thick layer. Place the provolone slices over the rice in the pan. Spoon about three-quarters of the sausage filling over the provolone, filling it to 1/2 inch from the top. Pat the remaining rice mixture on top to enclose the filling, then sprinkle with the remaining 3 tablespoons pecorino cheese. Put the pan on the hot baking sheet and bake until golden, about 20 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool, 5 minutes.\n            \n\n              Run a small knife around the edge of the pan to loosen the timbale, then remove the side of the pan. Slide a spatula under the timbale and transfer it to a platter. Thin the remaining sausage filling with a splash of water and reheat.
