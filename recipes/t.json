Set aside and keep warm.\u00a0\n            \n\n              For the turkey gravy: Put the turkey gravy in a small saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the chicken stock and the defatted liquid from the baking sheet. Cook about 3 minutes. Add the Cheddar and cook, stirring, until melted and smooth, about 2 minutes more. Stir in the dried sage and a pinch of black pepper. Set aside and keep warm.\u00a0\n            \n\n              For the cranberry relish: Stir together the cranberry sauce, lemon zest, cinnamon, a pinch of salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl.\u00a0\n            \n\n              To assemble the sandwiches: Slice the turkey breasts into 1/4- to 3/8-inch-thick slices and halve each biscuit. Melt the butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Working in batches, fry the eggs until the whites are set and the yolks are runny, about 3 minutes each. Sprinkle each egg with a pinch of salt and black pepper.\n            \n\n              Place a heaping tablespoon of cranberry sauce on the bottom half of each biscuit. Top the cranberry sauce with 1/3 cup home fries. Top the home fries with 3 slices of roasted turkey breast. Drizzle each sandwich with 2 tablespoons of warm gravy and top with more cranberry sauce. Gently place a fried egg on top of each and sprinkle with the parsley. Top each sandwich with the top half of the biscuits and serve immediately.\n            \n", "ingredients": [{"food": "smoked turkey roll", "quantity": 11.0}, {"food": "smoked turkey roll", "quantity": 3.0}, {"food": "butter oil", "quantity": 4.0}, {"food": "vegetable oil", "quantity": 4.0}, {"food": "carrots", "quantity": 4.0}, {"food": "garlic powder", "quantity": 4.0}, {"food": "celery seed", "quantity": 2.0}, {"food": "pasta with sliced franks in tomato sauce", "quantity": 1.0}, {"food": "onion powder", "quantity": 1.0}, {"food": "black bean mango", "quantity": 1}, {"food": "rosemary", "quantity": 4.0}, {"food": "thyme", "quantity": 4.0}, {"food": "sage", "quantity": 2.0}, {"food": "poultry seasoning", "quantity": 2.0}, {"food": "pillsbury golden layer buttermilk biscuits", "quantity": 16.0}, {"food": "butter oil", "quantity": 2.0}, {"food": "", "quantity": 0.5}, {"food": "potato flour", "quantity": 1.0}, {"food": "vegetable oil", "quantity": 2.0}, {"food": "black bean mango", "quantity": 1}, {"food": "smoked turkey roll", "quantity": 12.0}, {"food": "diced chicken", "quantity": 0.25}, {"food": "meat drippings ", "quantity": 0.3333333333333333}, {"food": "sage", "quantity": 1.0}, {"food": "black bean mango", "quantity": 1}, {"food": "Worcestershire sauce", "quantity": 14.0}, {"food": "lemon juice", "quantity": 1.0}, {"food": "cinnamon", "quantity": 1.0}, {"food": "black bean mango", "quantity": 1}, {"food": "butter oil", "quantity": 2.0}, {"food": "eggs", "quantity": 8.0}, {"food": "black bean mango", "quantity": 1}, {"food": "parsley", "quantity": 0.25}], "title": "\nThanksgiving Turkey Biscuit Sandwiches\n"}, {"directions": "\n\n              1.
